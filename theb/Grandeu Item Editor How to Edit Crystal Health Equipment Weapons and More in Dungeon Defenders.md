## Tips and Tricks for Dungeon Defenders
 
Now that you know how to use Grandeu Item Editor for Dungeon Defenders, you might be wondering how to improve your gameplay and get the most out of this fun and challenging game. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you become a better defender:

- Use the shift and ctrl keys to quickly assign skill points. You can hold shift + click to put on 5 skill points, and ctrl + click for 100. This will save you time and hassle when leveling up your heroes.
- Upgrade your resistances every 10 levels. If your resistances have reached the cap, you can upgrade one of them every 10 upgrade levels. This will help you survive longer in higher difficulties.
- Swap your characters' positions in the swap hero menu. You can click on a character in the swap hero menu, then hold alt and press on another character to swap their positions. This will make it easier to access your favorite heroes.
- Use the map to teleport as a summoner in phase shift overlord mode. While in phase shift overlord mode, you can hold down shift and press on where you want to be on the map. This will teleport you there instantly. This is useful for making quick builds and repairs.
- Play pure strategy mode for lots of experience. Pure strategy mode is a mode where you can only use defenses and not weapons or abilities. This mode is very easy and gives you a lot of experience. You can play it on insane hardcore tavern defense for the best results.
- Use pets and accessories to boost your speed. If you want to move faster, you can use pets and accessories that give you a speed bonus. For example, the diamond gives you a 40% speed bonus, the turtle gives you a 30% speed bonus, and the skeleton gives you a 35% speed bonus.
- Switch back to the original hero after placing a tower. If you place a tower with one hero and then switch to another hero, the tower's damage will go down. To avoid this, switch back to the original hero after placing a tower.
- Read your parents' message in the secret room. If you complete all the campaign missions, you can access a secret room in the tavern by going through the top door. In this room, you can zoom in and go to the right corner to see a message from your parents. It says: "Don't listen to the tavernkeep."
- Play survival mode for good items. Survival mode is a mode where you have to survive as many waves of enemies as possible. This mode gives you good items as rewards. Some of the best maps for survival mode are The Throne Room, Endless Spires, Aquanos, Kings Game, and Tinkerer's Lab.
