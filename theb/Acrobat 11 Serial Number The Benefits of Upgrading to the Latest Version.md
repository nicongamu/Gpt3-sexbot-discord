# How to Find Your Acrobat 11 Serial Number
 
If you have purchased Adobe Acrobat 11, you will need your serial number to activate and use the software. The serial number is a 24-digit code that is unique to your product and license. Without it, you will not be able to access the full features of Acrobat 11.

But what if you have lost or forgotten your serial number? How can you find it again? In this article, we will show you some easy ways to locate your Acrobat 11 serial number, whether you have a physical or digital copy of the software.
 
## Method 1: Check Your Email or Adobe Account
 
If you have bought Acrobat 11 online from Adobe or an authorized reseller, you should have received an email confirmation with your serial number. You can search your email inbox for messages from Adobe or containing the word "Acrobat". If you find the email, you can copy and paste the serial number from there.
 
Alternatively, you can log in to your Adobe account and go to [https://account.adobe.com/products](https://account.adobe.com/products). There, you will see a list of your registered products and their serial numbers. You can click on the "Show" button next to Acrobat 11 to reveal your serial number.
 
## Method 2: Check Your Packaging or Receipt
 
If you have bought Acrobat 11 as a physical product, such as a DVD or a box, you should find your serial number on a sticker or a card inside the packaging. The serial number may be labeled as "Serial", "Key", or "SN". You can enter the serial number exactly as it appears on the sticker or card.
 
If you have bought Acrobat 11 from a retail store, you may also find your serial number on your receipt or invoice. You can check the receipt for any codes or numbers that match the format of a serial number. You can also contact the store where you bought the product and ask them if they can provide you with your serial number.
 
## Method 3: Check Your Registry or Preferences
 
If you have already installed and activated Acrobat 11 on your computer, you may be able to find your serial number in your system registry or preferences. However, this method requires some technical skills and caution, as modifying the registry or preferences incorrectly can cause serious problems to your computer.
 
For Windows users, you can use a registry editor such as Regedit to navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Adobe\Adobe Acrobat\11.0\Registration\SERIAL`. There, you should see a value that contains your serial number. You can copy and paste the value from there.
 
For Mac users, you can use a text editor such as TextEdit to open the file `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe PCD/cache/cache.db`. There, you should see a line that contains your serial number. You can copy and paste the line from there.
