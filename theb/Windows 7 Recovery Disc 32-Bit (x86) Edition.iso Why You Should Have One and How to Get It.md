# How to Create and Use a Windows 7 Recovery Disc 32-Bit (x86) Edition
 
If you have a Windows 7 computer that is running on a 32-bit (x86) processor, you may need a recovery disc in case something goes wrong with your system. A recovery disc can help you troubleshoot and fix common problems, such as boot errors, corrupted files, virus infections, or hardware failures. You can also use a recovery disc to restore your computer to its factory settings or to a previous backup point.

A recovery disc is different from an installation disc, which is used to install or reinstall Windows 7 on your computer. A recovery disc does not contain the Windows 7 operating system files, but only the tools and options to repair or restore your system. You cannot use a recovery disc to install Windows 7 on a new or formatted hard drive.
 
To create a Windows 7 recovery disc 32-bit (x86) edition, you will need a blank CD or DVD and a CD/DVD burner. You will also need to download the Windows 7 recovery disc image file from the official Microsoft website. The file name is `Windows 7 Recovery Disc 32-Bit (x86) Edition.iso` and it is about 143 MB in size. You can download it from this link: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7)
 
After you download the file, you will need to burn it to a CD or DVD using a software that can handle ISO files, such as ImgBurn, CDBurnerXP, or Nero. You can follow the instructions from the software to burn the ISO file to a disc. Make sure you choose the option to verify the disc after burning to ensure there are no errors.
 
Once you have created the recovery disc, you can use it to boot your computer and access the recovery options. To do this, you will need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings to make your CD/DVD drive the first boot device. You can usually access the BIOS settings by pressing a key such as F2, F10, F12, or Del when you turn on your computer. The exact key may vary depending on your computer model and manufacturer.
 
After you change the boot order, insert the recovery disc into your CD/DVD drive and restart your computer. You should see a message that says "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key and wait for the Windows 7 recovery environment to load.
 
In the recovery environment, you will see several options to repair or restore your system. You can choose from:
 
- **Startup Repair:** This option will automatically scan and fix problems that prevent Windows from starting normally.
- **System Restore:** This option will allow you to restore your system to an earlier point in time when it was working properly. You will need to have created a system restore point beforehand.
- **System Image Recovery:** This option will allow you to restore your system from a backup image that you have created using the Windows Backup and Restore feature. You will need to have an external hard drive or a network location where you have saved the backup image.
- **Windows Memory Diagnostic:** This option will test your computer's memory for errors and report any problems.
- **Command Prompt:** This option will open a command prompt window where you can run various commands and tools to troubleshoot and repair your system.

You can use the arrow keys and the Enter key to select an option and follow the on-screen instructions. If none of the options work or if you want to cancel the recovery process, you can choose **Exit** and restart your computer normally.
