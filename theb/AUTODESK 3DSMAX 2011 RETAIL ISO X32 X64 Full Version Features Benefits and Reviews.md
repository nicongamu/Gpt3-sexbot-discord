- Make sure you have entered the correct IMEI number for your phone. Double-check it by dialing \*#06# on your phone.
- Make sure you have selected the correct phone model from the list. If your phone model is not listed, try selecting a similar one or contact the developer for support.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection while using Mobex Nokia Unlocker V4.0. The program needs to connect to a server to generate the unlock codes.
