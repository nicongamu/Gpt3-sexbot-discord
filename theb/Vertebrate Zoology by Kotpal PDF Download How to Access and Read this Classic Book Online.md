# How to Download and Install Net Surveillance Software ActiveX Control
 
Net Surveillance Software is a web-based application that allows you to view and control your security cameras from any browser that supports ActiveX controls. ActiveX controls are small apps that allow websites to provide content such as videos and games. They also let you interact with content like toolbars and stock tickers when you browse the web[^2^]. However, these apps can sometimes malfunction, or give you content that you don't want. In some cases, these apps might be used to collect info from your PC, damage info on your PC, install software on your PC without your agreement, or let someone else control your PC remotely[^2^]. Therefore, you should only download and install ActiveX controls from trusted sources.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install the Net Surveillance Software ActiveX control on a Windows PC in Internet Explorer for a Smart Security Solutions NVR or DVR direct from a PC on the local area network. This method is based on a YouTube video by Smart Security Solutions[^1^] and a forum post by Tech Support Guy[^3^]. You can also watch the video or visit the forum for more details and troubleshooting tips.
