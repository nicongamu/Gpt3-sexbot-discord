Macroeconomic Theory by ML Jhingan is divided into six parts. The first part introduces the basic concepts and tools of macroeconomics, such as the national income accounting, the circular flow of income, the Say's law of markets, and the effective demand principle. The second part deals with the classical and Keynesian theories of income and employment, and explains how the equilibrium level of income and output is determined by the aggregate demand and supply functions. The third part covers the role of money and banking in the economy, and analyzes how the money market equilibrium and the interest rate are affected by the monetary policy and the demand and supply of money. The fourth part examines the various models of economic growth and development, and compares the different approaches to explain the sources and determinants of economic growth. The fifth part discusses the causes and consequences of inflation and deflation, and evaluates the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies to stabilize the economy. The sixth part explores the issues related to the open economy macroeconomics, such as the balance of payments, the exchange rate, the international trade, and the international monetary system.
